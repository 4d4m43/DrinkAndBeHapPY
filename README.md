Project Proposal
Project Title: Drink and be hapPY
Team Members: Clark Davis, Adam Abdelmalek, Alice Yu
Write this as a brief summary of your interests and intent, including:
Our project is to uncover patterns and correlations between happiness by country and alcohol consumption and weather. We will examine relationships between various countries throughout the world and determine whether there is correlation with amount of alcohol consumed and annual days of sunshine.
The kind of data you'd like to work with/field you're interested in (e.g., geodata, weather data, etc.)
•	Alcohol consumption data
•	World Happiness Project data
•	Weather data
The kinds of questions you'll be asking of that data
•	What are the happiest countries?
•	Which countries have the most alcohol consumption? Least?
•	Which countries have the most sunshine?
•	Is there a correlation between alcohol consumption and happiness?
•	Is there a correlation between alcohol consumption and weather?
•	Is there a correlation between weather and happiness?
Possible source for such data
•	Happiness Index 2017/ 2018 
o	http://worldhappiness.report/ed/2018/
•	http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.A1026?lang=en&showonly=GISAH
•	Weather API
Rough breakdown of tasks:
•	Look over happiness index and figure out countries
•	Google API to find long/lat for countries and plot heat map for the countries based on happiness
•	Visualizations
